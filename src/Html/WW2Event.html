            The second World War is a major global war between the Axis Powers and the allies between 1939 and 1945.
            During the peak of this war, nations put full war effort into it,
            using all capabilites of their ecnomies and civilian/military ressources.
            It’s also the most brutal war with the most documented casualties ever recorded.
            An estimated number counts up to 50 Million dead people during the war.
            World War 2 is also known for its horrific war crimes commited by the axis powers like the Holocaust.

                or the Ottoman Empire and new countries were created like the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which
                should unite all southern slavs under one state, Czechoslovakia, and many more.

                    In 1934, Austria is under the regime of Engelbert Dollfuss, called 'Austrofascism'. Dollfuss's goal is to keep his small nation
                    stable, but more importantly independent namely from Germany. Sadly for him, he was murdered during attempted coup by austrian nationalists.
                    His successor, Karl Schuschnigg, ruled Austria until 1938, and also tried to prevent the annexation of Austria, but the influence of the german
                    nationalists was too great. He was pushed to hold a vote for a annexation referendum. On March 12, 1938, German troops marched into Austria and short
                    time later, Austria was a part of Germany.

                    After the annexation of Austria, Hitler made further demands of territory. He claimed the Sudetenland, where many ethnic Germans are living and its
                    immediate cession to Germany. France and Britain didn't want a war, and so they accepted demands of Hitler, although, the government of czechoslovakia wasn't
                    involved in the talks. Between October 1 and 10, 1938, Germany annexed the Sudetenland.
                    At first it looked like, that Hitler would really back down, and the allies were relieved that the situation deescalated.
                    But in March 1939, the Czech part was invaded by the Germans. The remainder turned into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The slovak part was declared
                    independent and made a puppet state of Germany.

                <p class="normalText">
                    WW2 began with the invasion of Poland by both Germany and the Soviet Union.
                    The two sides signed a non-aggressive pact shortly before the attack on August 23, 1939 (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact).
                    German troops broke through polish defence lines and literally overran the polish military.
                    Britain and France declared war on Germany, beginning a period named the Phoney war (Okt 6, 1939- May 10,1940),
                    were actually nothing mentionable things happened.
                    After just one month, the capital Warsaw surrendered to the Germans.
                    The polish government, however, fled and continued the fight in exile. Both Germany and the Ussr split Poland.
                    Hitler sued for peace, but saying that Poland’s future will be decided by Germany and the Ussr.
                    Britain and France rejected this offer, and Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France,
                    which was postponed until the spring of 1940 due to „bad weather“.
                    The Ussr also forced the baltic states to sign pacts which granted Stalin more influence in the region.
                    Finnland rejected, and on November 1939, the Soviets invaded.
                    This war didn’t bring the result Stalin had hoped for and ended with some finnish territorial concessions.
                    In June 1940, the baltic states and the romanian regions of Bessarabia,
                    Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa Region, were occupied entirely by the Russians.

                    On May 10, German forces swept through Belgium and the Netherlands using a tactic named „Blitzkrieg“.
                    Three days later, they arrived at the river Meuse and defeated french troops at Sedan.
                    They surprised the allies by pushing the main force through the Ardenne forest, which they thought as naturally impenetrable.
                    They quickly surrounded a large majority of the french and british army. The british forces were evacuated by sea from Dunkirk in late May.
                    The rest of the french resistance in the south soon surrendered.
                    Italy now officially formed an alliance with Germany, declaring war against France and the UK.
                    On June 14, took over Paris and a new government was formed by Marshal Philippe Petain.
                    Japan entered the war by invading French Indochina. France surrendered and was divided into two zones.
                    One came under german occupation and the other became a satellite state known as French State.

                    The first step was Italy joining the war and the second letting France make a new government, which made it look like France switched sides.
                    Germany also prepared for a big invasion and he let the Brits know.
                    On September 27, 1940 Japan, Germany and Italy signed the Tripartite Pact, making Japan an official participant of the war on axis side.
                    But at first they needed supperiority in the air, and despite being outnumbered, the Royal Airforce (RA) defeated the Luftwaffe in late October, 1940.
                    The Brits were at their limits, but their luck, they received aid by the Americans by early 1941.
                    This was a heavy blow for Hitler as he was postpone his plans for a future invasion.

                    The Axis powers got new members as Hungary, Romania had joined by early 1941.
                    German troops overran Yugoslavia and Greece. But the real reason behing the conquest was the preparation for an invasion of Ussr,
                    because its territory would give the german „upper race“, the land they needed or what they called it „Lebensraum“.
                    On June 22, 1941 Germany attacked the Soviet Union.
                    Over the whole course of the operation more than 3 million active axis personnel – the largest invasion force in history - would fight against the Soviets.
                    This attack marked the escalation of the Second World War and the formation of the Allied coalition adding the Ussr.
                    Hitler also planned the extinction of all jews throughout europe.
                    In the next 3 years more than 4 million jews would be put in the death camps and suffer horrible conditions.

                <h4>WW2 in the Pacific</h4>
                <p class="normalText">
                    At this time, the US and Britain were the only ones that could compete in naval force to Japan.
                    And with Britain facing Germany in Europe, the US was on its own.
                    With Japans expansion into China and its seizing of European holdings in Asia, Japan made clear that it wanted more.
                    Japan was short in oil, that it needed desperately for its machinery. At this time, Oceania possessed the largest known oil reserves.

                    With the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941 they wanted to keep America out of their ambitions by threatening them.
                    However, this backfired as the public opinion massively favoured entering the war and on December 8th, the US declared war on Japan.
                    Germany and the other axis powers promptly declared war on the United States.
                    In the beginning, Japan came out victorious but with the US entering the war the tides changed soon after.
                    The Battle of Midway (June, 1942) marks the turning point of the 2nd World War in the Pacific. From late 1942 to early 1943,
                    the allies managed to defeat the Japanese in multiple battles, ending with a large counterattack in mid-1943, in which the allied forces took multiple key island.
                    This strategy named „island-hopping“ proved to be very successful. The ultimate goal to reach main-land Japan became more and more likely.

                <h4>Allied Way to Victory</h4>
                <p class="normalText">
                    The axis were defeated in North Africa by 1943 and in July the Allies invaded Sicily, with the help of italian locals with american relatives
                    and even the italian mafia. The Mussolini regime fell as the allies made their way up to northern Italy, however, their advance came to a hold until 1945.
                    Germany wasn’t able to reach Moscow, and due to the harsh and cold winter and special forces by the Soviets, the Germans were pushed back.
                    This forced Hitler to refocus his aims to Stalingrad and the regions in the south with a huge amount of oil reserves,
                    because like Japan, Germany needed this oil for their machinery.
                    The battle of Stalingrad faced one of the bloodiest combat of WW2 and ended in a soviet victory, largely due to their massive counterattack on November, 1942.
                    The remaining german troops suffered from shortage of food and medical supplies, which was further worsened by the winter.
                    The last german men surrendered in early January, 1943.
                    With the invasion of Normandy, what’s later celebrated as „D-Day“, british, american and canadian soldiers successfully made it onto mainland France,
                    opening a western front for Hitler. In response, they pulled their last remaining strength from the eastern front to stop allied advance in the west.
                    This, however, only ensured soviet victory in the east. Soviet forces soon entered Poland, Hungary and Czechia
                    while Hitler gathered his remaining troops for the last battle (Batlle of the Bulge, 1944/45).
                    And before allied troops entered german mainland, heavy bombardment destructed more cities.
                    And when Germany finally surrendered on May 8, 1945, the Soviet already took over a large amount of its territory in the east.
                    Hitler was already dead, having died by suicide on April 30 in his Bunker.

                    However, the war wasn't entirely over, because Japan didn't yet surrender. In the last months the US managed to conquer major islands
                    in the pacific until they finally got close enough to mainland Japan. Truman didnt want a invasion of Japan, as it would cost too much lives.
                    So he decided to put their new weapon into use, the nuclear bomb. In early August, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were hit by the bomb.
                    On August 15, Japan surrendered and accepted all terms of the Potsdam Declaration.

                    After german surrender in July/August 1945, Churchill, Stalin and US-President Harry S. Truman (Roosevelt died in July) discussed the still occurring
                    war in Asia with Japan and the future of europe, in particular, Germany.
                    Post-war Germany would be divided into 4 parts. One occupation zone for each power (US, Ussr, Britain, France).
                    And because the US needed the support of the Soviets in the war against Japan, they compromised to Stalin over the matter of eastern europe.

                    Shortly before the war ended in europe, the victorious powers negotiated with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Finland about the details of the treaty.

                    and to qualify for membership in the United Nations. However, the treaties also included war reparations, commitments, etc.
