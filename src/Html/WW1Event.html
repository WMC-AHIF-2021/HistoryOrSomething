                The 1st World War is result of years of imperialism and global dominance by europe.
                Thanks to the industrial revolution and the population boom, major powers like Britain, France, Germany and the USA/Japan controlled much of the world.
                Politcaly as well as economically, leaving only a few nations independent. Since the unification of Germany, the balance of power in Europe shifted.

                <p class="normalText">
                    June 28, 1914: To inspect the imperial armed forces, the austro-hungarian heir, Franz Ferdinand,
                    visited the capital Sarajevo of the newly annexed provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
                    This annexation provoked serbian nationalists, who believed that Bosnia should be part of Serbia.
                    Six assassins  from a organisation known as Young Bosnia or Mlada Bosna,
                    reinforced by the Black Hand, planned to kill the heir, in hope, that his death would free Bosnia from the Austrians.
                    The first attempt failed, injuring only some officers. However, one hour later, Ferdinand returned to visit the injured officers and his car took a wrong turn.
                    Unfortunately, one of the assassins, Gavrilo Princip, was there and he took the chance to achieve his goal.
                    The heir and his wife were shot and died shortly after.

                    Its emperor, Willhelm II., secretly assured their assistance in form of the ‚Blank check‘, which gave Austria Germany’s full support in any action.
                    Austria sent an ultimatum, which included extremely harsh even unfair terms.
                    Knowing that Austria will declare war, Serbia began to mobilize its arms and on July 28th 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.
                    One thing leads to another and peace in europe has ended.

                    On August 4, 1914, German troops entered Belgium, forcing the UK to join the war on allied side.
                    At first, the Germans made quick progress, but Belgium slowed them down with fierce resistance.
                    In the assault for the heavily defended city of Liege, the Germans most powerful weapons came to play: enormous siege cannons.
                    The city was captured in August, 15. The brutal german war machine left death and destruction as they advanced through belgium, shooting multiple civilians.
                    They marched far into northeastern France until they were stopped by the allied forces.
                    In the Battle of Marne, September 5 to 12, british and french soldiers managed to defeat the Germans.
                    With a counterattack they drove them back to the Aisne River. This ruined the plan for the German Empire for a quick victory.
                    Now, both sides dug into trenches, creating a war of attrition, which should last for the next 3 years.
                    This trench war will cost many lives on both sides. War crimes were commited on both sides, too, but more on the german side.

                    Despite the victory, this loss of force in the wester front contributed to the defeat in Marne.

                Since 1914, the war raged on Russias border.
                Despite multiple offensives, russian forces couldn’t break through german lines.
                Combining the defeat on the battlefield, politcal instability, the missing food and other important needs increased tensions across the population,
                especially the lower classes like workers and peasants.
                This inner conflict ended with the Russian Revolution in 1917, in which the Bolsheviks, under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, took power.
                They pulled Russia out of the war, freeing the remaining german troops in the east.

                    The United States became one of wealthiest and strongest nations during the last century,
                    even topping the european powers. At the beginning of the war, the USA stayed neutral, and Germany wanted to keep it like that.
                    Luckily for Germany, many ethnic germans lived in the US and support was high. However, due to allied propaganda and Germany commiting war crimes
                    and sinking american ships, support rapidly stagnated. With Russia out of the war, Germany saw a chance to win the war, but for that,
                    the US needed to stay out of the war in europe. But the US already invested in allied resources and equipment,
                    so it looked extremely likely that they will join and help the allies.

                    The central powers knew with American entry into the war they had no chance to win,
                    so they decided to risk everything and attack with the full power they still had.
                    These attacks, also known as the German spring offensive (March 21, 1918- 18 July 1918),
                    was the last attempt to win the war before the american troops arrived.
                    Despite some success, the Germans suffered heavy casualties and in July 18, 1918,
                    the Entente regained the upper hand and began their counterattack
                    against the collapsing German Empire.
                    The central powers lost on all fronts. Bulgaria collapsed first, followed by the Ottoman Empire,
                    then Austria-Hungary and finally on November 11, 1918, Germany surrendered.
                    The Great War was over.

                    This treaty designated Germany to be fully responsible for WW1 and all damages/losses.
                    Also, they were forced to pay for the massive war damage,
                    which should cripple Germanys economy for the next decade. Germany lost land, like Alsace-Lorraine
                    and its prussian corridor, spliting Germany in two.

                    This treaty enabled peace between the allies and Austria.
                    It ensured the dismantlement oft he Austro-Hungarian Empire into smaller states, like Czechoslovakia
                    and the newly formed kingdom of Yugoslavia,
                    which merged all southern slavs. Romania got Transilvania and Bessarabia,
                    leaving Austria and Hungary as smaller countries as they were never before.

                    It manifested peace and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and its territory. It defines many of today's border in the near east.
                    Despite this, many allies of the entente felt cheated like the Emirate of Asir, which would later become Saudi-Arabia. They were promised
                    way more land than they actually got. But they were not the only one.
                    To keep everyone on board, the British often gave unattainable promises.
