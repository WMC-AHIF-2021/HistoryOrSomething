        It's 1812, and France, under the leadership of Napoleon, has been at war<br>
        for the past 20 years and won every of the five coalitions.<br>
        France defeated many contributors such as Austria, Prussia and Sweden.<br>
        Furthermore, France created multiple Republics like the<br>
        Federation of the Rhine or a Republic in Switzerland.<br><br>

        Its economic blockade against Great Britain (1806) actually should weaken their enemy<br>
        and the island still felt the impact, but the UK avoided the biggest<br>
        economic downturn by simply increasing the trading with its colonies.<br>
        And to Napoleons disadvantage, the loyalty of his allies Spain and Russia began to crumble.<br>
        Spain was rebelling due to Napoleons intervention in the royal family and<br>
        Russia started trading with Britain in 1810, which lead to<br>
        Napoleons decision to invade Mother Russia.
