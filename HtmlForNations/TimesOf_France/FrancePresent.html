        In the modern day, France is still a influential nation as a founding
        member<br />
        of vaious important organisations such as the EU or the UNO.<br />
        It's economy is in the top 10 and the military of the french is also
        top-class. <br />
        With Britain out of the EU, France and Germany have become the major
        leaders of the Union. 
        <br>Because of historic reasons, many of its former colonies have<br />
        french as an official language, making french one of the most spread languages.<br /><br>
        France's Prime may be over and their status has started to fade,<br>
        but it still plays an important role in the
        world.
