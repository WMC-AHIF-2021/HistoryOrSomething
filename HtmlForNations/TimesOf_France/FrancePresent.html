        In the modern day, France is still a influential nation as a founding
        member<br />
        of vaious important organisations such as the EU or the UNO.<br />
        It's economy is in the top 10 and the military of the french is also
        top-class. <br />
        With Britain out of the Eu, France and Germany have become the major
        leaders
        <br />
        of the Union. And with all its problems like terrorism and the eastern
        thread,<br />
        France still endured all of it, and may also in the future.<br /><br />
        France's Prime may be over, but it still plays an important role in the
        world.
